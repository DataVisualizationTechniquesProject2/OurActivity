# Our Bike activity
This R project was done as a part of [Data Visualization Techniques](https://github.com/kozaka93/2023Z-DataVisualizationTechniques) course. To check how our project repository looks like, click this [link](https://github.com/DataVisualizationTechniquesProject2/Project2). The application was build by [Aleksandra Kwiatkowska](https://github.com/Alexa263), [Maciej Momot](https://github.com/MaciejMomot) and [Jakub Półtorak](https://github.com/JakubPoltorak147).

As we all are sport enthiusiasts, we have decided to analise and visualize data from our bike activities. We have managed to get data from 3 applications: Strava, Huawei Health and Garmin Connect. Check out, how our project looks like and what we included in our tabs.
